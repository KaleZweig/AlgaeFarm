  	The algae chosen is the product of our experiment as it reproduces exceptionally fast and has a higher yield than almost all other common plants used for biofuels such as the most popular, corn, followed by rice, oil palm and peanuts. In addition to its reproduction rate and high yield, algae can be easily grown and found in many different environments around the world. While the protist can be found in most regions of the Earth, it grows most efficiently in moist areas with moderate to high temperatures (about 70&deg; F to be exact) and maximum exposure to sunlight. For our project specifically we have chosen Chlorella regularis, a freshwater species of algae with a noticeably large lipid yield. We have designed our experiment and explored future ideas to meet the environmental needs of the algae such as our modular network design which allows the algae to receive maximum sunlight exposure and utilize roof space as well as the idea of incorporating a heating system which will allow the algae to grow efficiently in areas of colder climates. While a unique biofuel component algae is also extremely efficient and can easily sustain itself.
