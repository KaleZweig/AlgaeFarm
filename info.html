  Modular algae farming was developed by Kale Zweig and Lukas Seeley as a project entry for the Imagine Tomorrow competition hosted by Washington State University. The project was a participant for Ballard High School as part of a biotech Biology class. By speaking with multiple experienced engineers, biologists and other professionals with a background in the biofuel industry the team was able to develop a design which could solve the problem of unutilized roof space while creating a habitable environment for the algae. The future of Zweig and Seeley's algae product will include the exploration of ideas which will benefit the growth of the algae, the production rate and the scale of the model. The team has made multiple specific adjustments which will allow for smooth functioning of the model and futures models and they hope to see success at the rigorous Imagine Tomorrow competition in May of 2105.
